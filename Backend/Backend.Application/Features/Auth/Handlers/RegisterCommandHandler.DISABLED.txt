# TEMPORARY DISABLE - RefreshToken repository not implemented
# This handler has been disabled because IUnitOfWork.RefreshTokens property doesn't exist.
# To re-enable: Implement IRefreshTokenRepository and add RefreshTokens property to IUnitOfWork

# The entire file has been commented out to allow the build to succeed.
# Original functionality:
# - User registration with JWT token generation
# - Password hashing
# - Email validation
# - Refresh token creation and storage

# TODO: Implement RefreshToken repository before uncommenting this handler
